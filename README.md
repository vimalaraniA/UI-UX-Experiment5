## Aim:

To identify UX problems, select suitable UX research methods, and develop user personas for two UX project scenarios: a Health & Fitness App and an E-Government Service Portal.

## Algorithm:

First, I selected two UX project scenarios: a health & fitness mobile app and an e-government service portal.

Then, I observed and listed the major pain points and usability issues faced by users in both scenarios.

After identifying the problems, I framed 1–2 UX problem statements for each scenario using the required template.

Next, I chose appropriate UX research methods like interviews, surveys, usability testing, and heuristic evaluation based on the nature of each scenario and explained why they fit.

I then created two user personas for each scenario by defining their demographics, goals, behaviors, motivations, and pain points.

After preparing the personas, I compared both scenarios to highlight important UX insights and differences.

Finally, I organized all findings clearly and prepared the Lab 05 report in PDF format along with the GitHub repository link.

## Output:
Scenario 1: Health & Fitness App
Method	Justification
Usability - Testing	To observe where users struggle while logging activities.
Interviews - To understand motivations and frustration with tracking.

Scenario 2: E-Government Portal
Method	- Justification
Heuristic Evaluation -	Government systems often violate basic usability rules.
Surveys	To understand common difficulties faced by a large number of citizens.
Task Analysis	To measure completion time for service-related tasks.

Step 5:
Create user personas.

Scenario 1: Health & Fitness App
Persona 1: Akhil

Age: 24

Occupation: Software Engineer

Location: Chennai

Goals: Track workouts quickly

Behaviors: Uses app during short breaks

Pain Points: Confusing UI, slow logging

Persona 2: Nisha

Age: 19

Occupation: Student

Location: Bangalore

Goals: Learn workouts, see simple progress

Behaviors: Uses app 2–3 times/week

Pain Points: Complex graphs, too many alerts

Scenario 2: E-Government Service Portal
Persona 3: Ramesh

Age: 38

Occupation: Bank Employee

Location: Hyderabad

Goals: Apply for certificates quickly

Behaviors: Uses portal during work breaks

Pain Points: Slow pages, confusing service lists

Persona 4: Lakshmi

Age: 52

Occupation: Homemaker

Location: Coimbatore

Goals: Pay bills, download documents

Behaviors: Low digital literacy

Pain Points: Long forms, unclear instructions

Step 6:
Compare both scenarios and note UX insights.

The Health App requires simplicity and fast task completion.

The Government Portal requires clarity, guidance, and accessibility.

Both systems suffer from information overload and complex navigation.

## Result:

The UX problems, research methods, and user personas for both scenarios were clearly identified, analyzed, and documented successfully.
