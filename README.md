## Aim:

To understand and apply the process of identifying user experience (UX) problems, selecting appropriate research methods, and developing user personas for different project scenarios such as a health & fitness app and an e-government service portal.

## Algorithm:

Step 1: Select two different UX project scenarios (for example, a health app and an e-government portal).

Step 2: Identify the major user pain points or usability challenges in each scenario.

Step 3: Write 1–2 clear UX problem statements using the template:

"[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

Step 4: Choose appropriate UX research methods (such as surveys, interviews, usability testing, or heuristic evaluation) based on the scenario and justify why each method is suitable.

Step 5: Create user personas for each scenario using the following attributes:


Demographics (age, occupation, location)

Goals and motivations

Behaviors and pain points

Step 6: Summarize the findings by comparing both scenarios and noting key design insights.

Step 7: Document all findings clearly and submit the final report in PDF/Word format along with your GitHub repository URL.

## Output:

## Result:

The UX problems, suitable research methods, and user personas for both scenarios were successfully identified and documented.
